# POS Tagging with HMM vs CRF
This repository contains a basic implemention of Hidden Markov Model(HMM) and Conditional Random Field(CRF) for Part of Speech tagging in python 3.6. The aim is to show how both the model performs for the given task. Run the code to realise how CRF outperforms HMM for POS tagging task.
